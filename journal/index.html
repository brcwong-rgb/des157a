      <h2>Modals/Overlays/Dialog Window</h2>
      <p> After reading the article by Naema Baskanderi, I learned the importance of modals and overlays and their usecase. Initially they were implemented in order to save space and simplify interfaces. They are now being overused and have become distracting design elements that interrupt the user flow. </p>

      <p>As a designer and user, this is concerning as we have been trained to instantly close modals without fully processing their content, which defeats their intended purpose. This makes me question the validity of modals and how we can redesign this to be useful to the user. A key takeaway from Baskanderi's article was the emphasis on intentional use and accessibility. </p>

      <p>Best practices highlight how modals should support users rather than trap them. These best practices could be clear escape hatches and descriptive titles. It was interesting to read about accessibility guidance around keyboard navigation and ARIA roles. I realized that these are essential in order to create quality in the digital world. Overall, the article highlighted that modals should be used sparingly and thoughtfully in ways that make it accessible and easy to use for all users.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles to Form Design</h2>
        <p>Conversion is the most essential purpose of a form or application. Form design should be aesthetically pleasing while also being easy to use in order to increase conversion. It is important to ask only for essential information and avoid unnecessary questions that prolong the time it takes users to complete the form. </p>
        
        <p>Using single-column layouts allows for faster scanning, while breaking long forms into multiple steps with progress indicators helps reduce cognitive load. Grouping similar questions allows users to build momentum as they fill out the form. </p>
        
        <p>Clearly marking required and optional fields gives users more flexibility. Clear labels and accessible feedback further reduce user frustration and help users complete forms confidently and efficiently. Overall, user-centered form design reduces friction and ultimately increases the likelihood that users will complete the form and convert.

        <p>I think Spotify’s sign-up form is well designed because it prioritizes user experience while encouraging conversion. The form uses a progress bar to set expectations and asks only for essential information, making the sign-up processeasy for users to complete.
